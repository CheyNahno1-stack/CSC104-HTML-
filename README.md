# CSC104-HTML-
This is just the HTMIL aspect as of now for my final project 
I created three pages to start : Home page, Programs , and About us 
Within each page there are at least four to five sections with different information 
I added in a table on the programs page that displayed the prices on that page I added pictures in a different way
I added in the slideshow for the home page and about us 
The homepage i focused on hyperlinks to other pages even certain sections of other pages using an ID 
there is a navigation to each page and a footer.
